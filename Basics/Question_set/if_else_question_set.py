'''
Suppose that you are an invigilator in an exam.
A calculator is not allowed for the exam. You discover somehow that students are planning to cheat in exams,
using a calculator program in Python language. Somehow, you get your hands on the calculator program.
Now you want to alter a few results in the calculator with your own provided results to catch the 
students trying to cheat using the calculator program.

The user will provide the following inputs:

    Operator
    The two numbers between which the operator is applied

All the results will be correct, except for these few:

    45 * 3 = 555
    56+9 = 77
    56/6 = 4
