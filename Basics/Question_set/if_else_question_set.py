#   1. Write a Python script that takes a user's input of a number and prints "Positive" if it's greater than zero, "Negative" if it's less than zero, and "Zero" if it's equal to zero.
#   2. Create a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger number using if-else statements.
#   3. Write a Python script that takes a user's input of an age and prints "Child" if the age is less than 18, and "Adult" if it's 18 or older.
#   4. Create a Python function that takes a year as input and prints "Leap year" if it's divisible by 4, otherwise prints "Not a leap year" using if-else statements.
#   5. Write a Python script that takes a user's input of a temperature in Celsius and prints "Freezing" if it's below 0째C, "Normal" if it's between 0째C and 25째C, and "Hot" if it's above 25째C.
#   6. Create a Python function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest number using if-else statements.
#   7. Write a Python script that takes a user's input of a string and prints "Long" if the length of the string is greater than 10 characters, otherwise prints "Short".
#   8. Create a Python function that takes a grade (A, B, C, D, F) as input and prints "Pass" if the grade is A, B, or C, otherwise prints "Fail".
#   9. Write a Python script that takes a user's input of two numbers and prints "Even" if both numbers are even, "Odd" if both numbers are odd, and "Mixed" otherwise.
#   10. Create a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and prints "Increasing" if the numbers are in increasing order, "Decreasing" if they're in decreasing order, and "Unordered" otherwise.
#   11. Write a Python script that takes a user's input of a number and prints "Divisible by 5" if it's divisible by 5, "Divisible by 3" if it's divisible by 3, and "Not divisible by 3 or 5" otherwise.
#   12. Create a Python function that takes a number as input and prints "Prime" if it's a prime number, otherwise prints "Not a prime number" using if-else statements.
