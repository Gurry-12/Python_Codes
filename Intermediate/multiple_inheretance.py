# Certainly! Here are some questions focused on multiple inheritance in Python:

# ### Multiple Inheritance Problems

# 1. **Create two base classes `Flyable` and `Swimmable` each with a method `move`. Implement a subclass `Duck` that inherits from both `Flyable` and `Swimmable` and overrides the `move` method to print both flying and swimming actions.**

# 2. **Define two classes `Teacher` and `Engineer` each with an attribute `name` and a method `work`. Create a subclass `TeacherEngineer` that inherits from both classes and overrides the `work` method to include both teaching and engineering activities.**

# 3. **Create two classes `Person` and `Athlete` each with an attribute `name` and a method `introduce`. Implement a subclass `AthleticPerson` that inherits from both and overrides the `introduce` method to include information from both base classes.**

# 4. **Write two classes `MusicPlayer` and `VideoPlayer` each with methods `play` and `stop`. Create a subclass `MediaPlayer` that inherits from both and overrides the `play` and `stop` methods to handle both music and video.**

# 5. **Define two classes `ElectricVehicle` and `GasVehicle` each with an attribute `fuel_type` and a method `refuel`. Implement a subclass `HybridVehicle` that inherits from both and provides its own `refuel` method.**

# 6. **Create two classes `Readable` and `Writable` each with a method `access`. Create a subclass `File` that inherits from both and overrides the `access` method to handle both reading and writing.**

# 7. **Write two classes `Artist` and `Writer` each with a method `create_art` and `write_book` respectively. Implement a subclass `CreativePerson` that inherits from both and adds a method `create` to call both `create_art` and `write_book`.**

# 8. **Define two classes `DesktopComputer` and `Laptop` each with an attribute `processor`. Create a subclass `HybridComputer` that inherits from both and adds a method to display processor information from both base classes.**

# 9. **Create two classes `Chef` and `Driver` each with methods `cook` and `drive`. Implement a subclass `PersonalAssistant` that inherits from both and overrides the methods to include multitasking actions.**

# 10. **Write two classes `Doctor` and `Pilot` each with an attribute `license_number` and a method `work`. Create a subclass `DoctorPilot` that inherits from both and overrides the `work` method to include both medical and aviation activities.**

# 11. **Define two classes `Runner` and `Swimmer` each with an attribute `speed`. Implement a subclass `Triathlete` that inherits from both and adds a method to display combined speed.**

# 12. **Create two classes `SolarPowered` and `BatteryPowered` each with an attribute `power_source` and a method `generate_power`. Implement a subclass `HybridDevice` that inherits from both and overrides the `generate_power` method to combine both sources.**

# 13. **Write two classes `Mother` and `Father` each with an attribute `surname`. Create a subclass `Child` that inherits from both and adds a method to display the combined surname.**

# 14. **Define two classes `Car` and `Boat` each with an attribute `vehicle_type`. Implement a subclass `AmphibiousVehicle` that inherits from both and overrides the attribute to indicate it can operate both on land and water.**

# 15. **Create two classes `Keyboard` and `TouchScreen` each with methods `input_text`. Implement a subclass `HybridInputDevice` that inherits from both and overrides the `input_text` method to handle both input types.**
