# Sure! Here are some questions that focus on inheritance in Python, including practical applications:

# ### Inheritance Problems

# 1. **Create a base class `Animal` with a method `speak`. Then create two subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` that override the `speak` method to print "Bark" and "Meow" respectively.**

# 2. **Write a class `Vehicle` with attributes `make` and `model`. Create a subclass `Car` that adds the attribute `number_of_doors` and a method `display_info` to show all attributes.**

# 3. **Define a class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`. Create a subclass `Student` that adds the attribute `student_id` and a method `study`.**

# 4. **Create a class `Shape` with a method `area` that raises `NotImplementedError`. Implement two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that override the `area` method to return the area of the shape.**

# 5. **Write a class `Employee` with attributes `name` and `salary`. Create a subclass `Manager` that adds the attribute `department` and a method to display all attributes.**

# 6. **Define a class `Account` with attributes `account_number` and `balance`. Create a subclass `SavingsAccount` that adds the attribute `interest_rate` and a method to calculate interest.**

# 7. **Create a class `Device` with attributes `brand` and `model`. Create a subclass `Phone` that adds the attribute `phone_number` and a method to make a call.**

# 8. **Write a class `LibraryItem` with attributes `title` and `author`. Create a subclass `Book` that adds the attribute `isbn` and a method to display all attributes.**

# 9. **Define a class `Appliance` with attributes `brand` and `power`. Create a subclass `WashingMachine` that adds the attribute `load_capacity` and a method to display all attributes.**

# 10. **Create a base class `Account` with methods `deposit` and `withdraw`. Implement two subclasses `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` that override these methods to include specific fees or interest calculations.**

# 11. **Write a class `Building` with attributes `address` and `floors`. Create a subclass `OfficeBuilding` that adds the attribute `number_of_offices` and a method to display all attributes.**

# 12. **Define a class `Instrument` with a method `play`. Create two subclasses `Piano` and `Guitar` that override the `play` method to print specific sounds for each instrument.**

# 13. **Create a class `Product` with attributes `name` and `price`. Create a subclass `Electronics` that adds the attribute `warranty` and a method to display all attributes.**

# 14. **Write a class `Vehicle` with attributes `make` and `model`. Create a subclass `Truck` that adds the attribute `payload_capacity` and a method to display all attributes.**

# 15. **Define a class `Member` with attributes `name` and `membership_number`. Create a subclass `PremiumMember` that adds the attribute `membership_level` and a method to display all attributes.**
