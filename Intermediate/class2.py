# Certainly! Here are some questions that focus on the practical application of static methods and class methods in Python:

# 1. **Define a Python class named `MathOperations` 
# that includes a static method to calculate the square of a number.**

# 2. **Create a class `TemperatureConverter` with static methods to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.**

# 3. **Write a class `Utilities` with a static method that checks if a string is a palindrome.**

# 4. **Define a class `Date` with a class method `today` that returns the current date.**

# 5. **Create a class `Employee` with a class attribute `employee_count`. Include a class method to increment this count every time a new employee is created.**

# 6. **Write a class `Logger` with a class attribute `log_file`. Include a static method to log messages to this file.**

# 7. **Define a class `Vehicle` with a class method `from_string` that takes a string in the format "make,model,year" and returns a new instance of the class.**

# 8. **Create a class `Bank` with a static method to validate if a given account number follows the bank's account number format.**

# 9. **Write a class `Configuration` with a class attribute `settings` (a dictionary). Include a class method to update these settings.**

# 10. **Define a class `Calculator` with a static method to add two numbers and a class method to store and retrieve the last calculated result.**

# 11. **Create a class `Planet` with a class attribute `planet_count`. Include a class method to keep track of the number of planets created.**

# 12. **Write a class `FileManager` with static methods to read from and write to a file.**

# 13. **Define a class `Student` with a class attribute `school_name`. Include a class method to change the school name for all students.**

# 14. **Create a class `Shape` with a static method to calculate the area of a rectangle and a class method to set a default color for all shapes.**

# 15. **Write a class `Conversion` with static methods for various unit conversions (e.g., kilometers to miles, pounds to kilograms).**
